        <h3>Home >> Shippimg Policy</h3> <br> <br>
        <p>
            A&C Billiards and Barstools primary goal is customer satisfaction.  If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you can return most new and unopened items.  You can return items within 30 days from the original date of purchase if not used.  We cannot accept items after this period.  The purchaser is responsible for returned shipping cost. <br><br>

            Shipping Damage Policy: <br> <br>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Occasionally items will be delivered with damage. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The purchaser isn’t responsible for the damage. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Shipping paperwork needs to be noted and signed that the product was received with visible packaging damage to validate product was damaged by shipper. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                A&C Billiards and Barstools has the right to determine whether or not the product should be replaced or repaired. <br> <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Mail Returns:  In order to receive a full refund, please include the original packing slip and the item in the original condition that it was delivered.  The customer may be responsible for shipping fees when the item is returned.  Once we receive the items, then we will process the refund for those items. <br> <br>

Freight Shipping:  Many of our products are too large to simply pack in a box and ship using standard methods.  For this reason, we utilize freight shipping to get your product to you.  All our larger items will be shipped using one of our preferred freight carriers, including UPS Freight, Hercules and ABF Freight (but are not limited to)  After your order is placed, it should arrive on your doorstep in 7-10 business days.  When it arrives, expect to find it in one or more boxes on a wooden pallet. Once your item is en route, you will receive a call to schedule delivery of your item.  Please note that the shipping companies will not deliver inside of your home.   If you need them to bring the item inside your home, or for any other questions, please contact us at info@bestpooltablesforsale.com before placing your order.   In case of returns, it’s recommended you keep the pallet & other packaging. <br> <br>

Standard Shipping:  A large number of our products are small and light enough to ship using standard methods.  For these items, we utilize FedEx Ground.  As with our freight items, expect these to arrive within 4-6 business days after placing your order. <br> <br>
